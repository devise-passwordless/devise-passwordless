# Rails 7.0.8 uses concurrent-ruby version 1.3.5 which has a
# known issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/54263, causing
# a ActiveSupport::LoggerThreadSafeLevel::Logger error and breaking
# all tests.
# This is fixed in Rails 7.1+
# The recommended solution for Rails 7 is to downgrade to 
# version 1.3.4.
